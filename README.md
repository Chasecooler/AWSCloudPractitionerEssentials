## Intro to AWS Cloud Concepts 
**SCALABILITY (resize resources as needed), AGILITY (learn from and quickly adapt to change), RELIABILITY, SECURITY**

- **Move from Data Centers to Cloud** -- Before cloud computing, enterprises designed and built own data centers.  If under-planned, risked poor performance; if over-planned (planned for worst case scenario), risked wasting money.  Cloud computing enables customers to access data centers and all of its resources via the internet.  This elastic infrastructure of cloud computing frees enterprises from the constraints of fixed and finite IT infrastructure, and minimizes the uncertainty of forecasting hardware needs.  **ELASTICITY** allows enterprises to easily scale computing resources up (as workload grows) or down (when certain resources are no longer required).  Specifically, the AWS tools Autoscaling and Elastic Load Balancing enable applications to automatically scale up or down based on demand.  With the cloud, customers/enterprises easily adapt their consumption of services to meet seasonal requirements / accommodate new strategic directions.

- **DATA SECURITY** -- Security of customer’s data a top priority for Amazon.

- **HIGH AVAILABILITY AND DEPENDABILITY** -- AWS facilities exist all over the world; as a result, AWS customers can literally have a global reach with just a moment’s notice (lower latency).

- **AGILITY** -- Change management & testing & reliability & capacity planning become more agile and efficient with the AWS cloud.  Since cloud computing learns from and quickly adapts to change, it reduces risks (and reduces the cost of change). 

- **AWS PRIORITIZES RELIABLE COVERAGE** -- The AWS Cloud has a high fault tolerance (system can remain operational even if some components of the system fail).

- **SERVICES** -- Cloud computing offers on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the internet; compute and storage resources available whenever needed.  AWS offers compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer and management tools, IOT, security, and enterprise applications.  AWS’ predeveloped services can be quickly assembled as building blocks – automate software delivery and create security and compliance guardrails.

## AWS Management Interfaces
**MANAGEMENT CONSOLE, CLI, SDKs (CLI & SDKs are tools to customize AWS features)**

Three ways to use AWS:
- **AWS Management Console (GUI that supports majority of AWS)**
  - Available as a mobile app to access features on the go
  - Resource groups are specific to identities (each user in account can customize)

- **Command Line Interface (CLI – open source tool built for interacting with AWS services)**
  - Programming language agnostic
  - Flexibility to create scripts (automate and repeat deployment of AWS resources)
  - Environments: (i) Linux, (ii) Windows, (iii) Remotely (run commands on Amazon EC2 instances, SSH, or with Amazon EC2 Systems Manager)

- **Software Development Kits (SDKs – offers flexibility to create applications and use AWS in existing applications)**
  - Incorporate the connectivity and functionality of the wider range of AWS Cloud Services into your code
  - Enable applications built on AWS to manage your infrastructure’s code
  - Access AWS using a variety of popular programming languages (JavaScript, Python (boto), PHP, .NET, Ruby, Go, Node.js, C++, Java)
